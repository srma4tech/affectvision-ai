## 10. Guardrails and Responsible Use
- Product assists interview quality monitoring; does not make final hiring decisions
- Show confidence and limitations in all insights
- Prevent protected-attribute inference or discriminatory scoring use
- Human reviewer remains accountable for evaluation outcomes

## 11. MVP vs Enterprise Boundaries

## 11.1 MVP (Org Pilot)
- Single-region deployment
- Core roles: Admin, Recruiter, Interviewer
- Interviewer/interviewee synced flow
- Interviewee-only analytics and report
- Basic org dashboard and audit trail

## 11.2 Enterprise
- SSO/SCIM + advanced RBAC
- Multi-region controls and configurable data residency
- ATS/HRIS integrations
- Calibration workflows and advanced analytics
- Compliance evidence center and policy automation

## 12. Success Metrics

## 12.1 Product KPIs

## 12.3 Platform KPIs
- Sync event delivery success rate
- Session/report failure rate
- p50/p95 question propagation latency

## 13. Risks and Mitigations

1. Risk: Analytics over-trusted as hiring authority
- Mitigation: explicit guardrails, disclaimers, human decision checkpoints

2. Risk: Bias from environment/device quality
- Mitigation: quality scoring, confidence gating, calibration reviews

3. Risk: Compliance friction in enterprise procurement
- Mitigation: early SOC 2 roadmap, audit trails, configurable retention

4. Risk: Real-time channel instability at scale
- Mitigation: resilient event transport, retry strategy, fail-safe session fallback

## 14. High-Level Architecture (Target)
- Frontend: interviewer and interviewee clients + org admin dashboard
- Realtime service: WebSocket event bus for question/status/metrics transport
- API service: sessions, users, org settings, reports
- Worker service: report generation and async jobs
- Storage: PostgreSQL + object store + cache/queue
- Integrations layer: ATS/webhooks/meeting platform connectors

## 15. Delivery Plan

## Phase 1 (0-6 weeks) - Org Pilot Core
- Session lifecycle + interviewer/interviewee roles
- Interviewee-only analysis enforcement
- End-session report and basic org dashboard

## Phase 2 (6-12 weeks) - Governance and Scale
- RBAC hardening

## Phase 3 (12-20 weeks) - Enterprise and Integrations
- SSO/SCIM
- ATS integration
- Advanced analytics and calibration

## 16. Immediate Execution Checklist

2. Add scheduled interview metadata (org, role, slot, interviewer, candidate)
3. Move cross-screen sync from local channel to backend realtime layer
4. Persist interview events and report outputs
5. Build org monitoring dashboard v1
6. Implement consent, retention, and audit policies

## 17. Open Decisions
1. Initial ATS integration target (Greenhouse, Lever, Workday?)
2. Default retention policy for pilot customers
3. Whether to support recording storage in MVP or metadata-only mode
4. Pilot customer segment priority (startup, mid-market, enterprise)

## 18. Versioning
